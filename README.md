# 🥷 The Warriors of the Hidden Scroll: **PENTARA**
> *"The scroll was never meant to be read again..."*

## 🧧 Game Description

Centuries ago, five warriors trained under the same master — a legendary swordsage who guarded a hidden scroll: **The Art of the Universe**, a technique said to grant the power to rewrite fate through combat.

The master, aware of the scroll’s catastrophic potential, embedded its secrets within the bodies of his five disciples — not in writing, but in muscle memory and scars. Each warrior carried a fragment of the truth, never to reunite again.

But betrayal struck.  
Two of them — now **opponent samurai** — seek to **recreate the technique** and **ascend beyond mortality**. To do that, they must defeat the remaining three and extract the fragments from their souls — through battle.

The last three warriors do not fight for glory.  
They fight to protect the legacy...  
...and to ensure the scroll is never read again.
